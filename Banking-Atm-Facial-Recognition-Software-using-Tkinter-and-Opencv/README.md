Transactions using Face recognition

This is a system that uses facial recognition to conduct banking transactions. The user must first create an account with a password before being able to withdraw, deposit, transfer, and inquire about the balance in his account.

Jupyter Notebook and Python libraries (OpenCv, Tkinter, GUI) are used in the software.
